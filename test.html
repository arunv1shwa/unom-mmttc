            enhance higher education by focusing on teacher development,
            aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. It uses
            both traditional and innovative teaching methods to prepare
            faculty for the evolving education sector. The Centre promotes
            continuous learning, transforming institutions into excellence
            hubs in teaching, research, and development. NEP 2020 emphasizes
            motivated, capable faculty, highlighting the need for continuous
            professional development. The Malaviya Mission restructures
            existing capacity-building mechanisms to train faculty and staff
            across higher education institutions, aiming for significant
            improvements within two years in teaching, research, publication,
            and institutional development.</p>
